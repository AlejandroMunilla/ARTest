# ARTest
# Please see attached file called marker. Print that out or display it on any screen of any device to trigger the AR character. 
# Small test for AR using Unity Vuforia. It works well, easy to set up. Basically placing the marker anywhere, or having it on the screen on any device triggers 
# any gameobject or character associated to that marker (Texture). 
# I added a GUI system connected to the character associated with the marker so by touching the buttons on the screen of the mobile, they would trigger animations
# on the character.
